<center><h1>Animal Farm writing (FIXED)</h1></center>
<center><h3>     Welcome to fixed version of Animal Farm writing!</h3></center>
<center><h3>     My favorite character in <i>Animal Farm</i> is Boxer, A fictional character created by George Orwell in the book Animal Farm. I am going to list two reasons in this writing.</h3></center>
<center><h3>     One of the primary reasons lies in his diligence. In Jone’s time, he kept doing hardest work. In contrast, the other animals did not woke up as early as him. Also, they worked according to their own capacity while Boxer worked beyond his capacity. After the rebellion, Boxer worked even harder. For instance, he asked chickens to wake him up even earlier than Jone’s time. Regardless of what happened outside the world, he still spared no effort to make contribution to Animal Farm. He had been accumulating stones before his death.</h3></center>
<center><h3>     Furthermore, his bravery is appealing. A typical example can be found in the Battle of Cowshed. In Chapter 3, for instance, “rearing up on his hind legs and striking out with his great iron-shod hoofs like a stallion.” This quote shows that even when he was facing danger he did not act like a coward, instead he fought like a brave man.</h3></center>
<center><h3>     In conclusion, considering the above-mentioned details of Boxer’s characteristics, including his hard work and courage, boxer the horse becomes  my favorite character in this book.</h3></center>
<center><h3>--The End--</h3></center>
<center><p>"ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL, BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS"</p></center>
