<center><h1>Animal Farm Review Chapter 1-6</h1></center>
<center><h3>     My teacher assigned me to read Chapters 1-6 of the book Animal Farm by <a style= " text-decoration:none; " href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell" target="_blank" ><span style="color: #0083FF">George Orwell</span></a>. Based on what I read, I think it is a dark story. Sometimes I got mad at some of the scenes. So today I will share my point of view.</h3>
<h3>     This story starts with lots of animals with a farmer called Mr. Jones and his four-man. However, there is a pig named Old Major who told animals to fight against man. Eventually, they've done the rebellion and renamed it "Animal Farm"(Originally "Manor Farm"). The leader of the animal farm is called Snowball, a pig, and everyone obeys him. But Napoleon gets jealous and made arguments with Snowball. </h3>
<h3>     One day, Snowball came up with the windmill idea, which will make the farm much better. But Napoleon stands a different view, which is all the animals should defend themselves.</h3>
<h3>     However, after they've done a vote on the two views and it did not go well. So, Napoleon got nine young dogs out and ran after Snowball. After Snowball's expulsion made Napoleon became the leader of Animal Farm. He told all the animals that build a windmill was his original idea. But the truth is that Windmill construction was Snowball's idea, which he got from books that Mr.Jone left off. Anyway, one day the animal farm's windmill is broken because of the bad weather, but Napoleon said that Snowball destroyed everything, which is not correct in my opinion. He also said that whoever catches Snowball alive gets plenty of goods.</h3>
<h3>     In conclusion, Napoleon in these six chapters disgusted me. If you have a different view, feel free to email me at <a style=" text-decoration:none; " href="mailto:andyc@realandychang.us" ><span style="color: #0083FF">Email me</span></a>!</h3></center>
