<center><h1>Animal Farm Review Chapter 1-6</h1></center>
<center><h3>     I am doing this review just for fun, So my teacher assigned me to read chapter 1-6 of book Animal Farm by <a style= " text-decoration:none; " href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell" target="_blank" ><span style="color: #0083FF">George Orwell</span></a>, and based on what I read it is a dark story and sometimes I get really angry on some of the contents. So today I am going to share my point of view based on Animal Farm!</h3>
<h3>     This story starts with lots of animals and a farmer called Mr.Jones and its four man. However, there is a pig called Old major told animals to fight against men, finally they've done that and they renamed the farm Animal Farm(Originally "Manor Farm") and the leader of the animal farm is Snowball(Pig), and everyone fully obey to Snowball. But one day, snowball come up with a windmill idea, which will make the farm much better, but another pig called Napoleon(Pig) stands a different view which is that animals should defend themselves</h3>
<h3>     However, after that they did a vote and it did not gone so well, but Napoleon got nine young dog out and chase after Snowball during the vote, which makes Snowball run away and Napoleon became the leader of the Animal Farm. After snowball is long gone, Napoleon actually said about his plan which is build windmill, and explain that Snowball stole his idea, but in face, snowball got these idea from books that Mr.Jone left off. Anyways, one day the animal farm's windmill is broken because of the bad weather, but Napoleon said that Snowball destoryed everything which is clearly not true. And he also said that whoever catch Snowball alive gets a lot of great things(I forgot what are those -v-).</h3>
<h3>     In conclusion, Napoleon in this 6 chapters is a really bad one to me, feel free to share your opinion by <a style=" text-decoration:none; " href="mailto:andyc@realandychang.us" ><span style="color: #0083FF">Email me</span></a>.</h3></center>
