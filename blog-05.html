<center><h3>     Hello! A few days ago, I got accepted by The Village School in Houston, Texas! In this article, I will tell you how I got in simultaneously talk about the steps.</h3></center>
<center><h3>     To start with, I will tell you what steps I took to get into The Village School. My first step was to submit a form including questions such as "What Books you've read?" and a lot more. About the same time, I sent the recommendation letter to my English teacher and my Math teacher. My math teacher replied to me very instant, but my English teacher somehow don't usually look at the mailbox, so it takes a long time.</h3></center>
<center><h3>     After the school received all the things they need, they will schedule an Oxford English test and an online meeting with you. For the online meeting, they will ask you some questions. All you need is to answer them or tell them the truth. It is not hard and all I can tell you is that when they ask you a simple question like "What do you like to do?" you should answer as long as possible. Make sure to write down some notes and keep practice.</h3></center>
<center><h3>     In conclusion, there are still things for me to work on, such as my grade and other problems that need to be solved. Thanks for reading!</h3></center>
<center><h3>--The End--</h3></center>
