<center><h1>Welcome to my blog</h1></center>
<center><h3>     Hello, welcome to my blog! Today our blog is launching and to me there are few things I want to talk about in this blog article. First one is that currently the blog website is just using normal background color not the background image, I think I can make more improvement to it. Second is that I don't know how to make a web port that is for my website, web port for me is like some sort of place where people can communicate online freely. If you want to help me on this program please message me on <a style= " text-decoration:none; " href="https://twitter.com/realandychang" target="_blank" ><span style="color: #0083FF">Twitter</span></a>.</h3></center>
<center><h3>     Now let me introduce you to my blog system, On home page you can look at all of the blogs I posted(P.S. This is not made with system/server. All scripted myself), Also I made a RETURN button where people can return to blog homepage. Currently there is no menu or search feature which might be available soon. Also I am planning to make monthly archive and list out all the blog I made each month. If it works successfully, then it will be out on Jan 31, 2021.</h3></center>
