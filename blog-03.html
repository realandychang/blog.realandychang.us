<center><h3>     Few days ago, I created the book review for first 6 chapter, today I am going to write down the favorite character for this book! (P.S. For school project again-v-), this is the non-edit version which means might contain errors. For edited version please look at page 2 of our blog page and see if it is out or not!</h3></center>
<center><h3>     My favorite character in <i>Animal Farm</i> is Boxer(A fictional character created by George Orwell in the book <i>Animal Farm</i> because I think that he is loyal, hard worker, and brave. In the book, Boxer have 2 mottos or principle. One of them was "I will work harder!"(Animal Farm) and after Napoleon(Fictional character created by George Orwell in the book <i>Animal Farm</i>) became the leader of the Animal Farm, he added another motto or principle which is "Napoleon is always right"(Animal Farm). This shows he is a hard worker, and also represents his loyalty to Animal Farm and to the leader, regardless it is Snowball(A fictional character created by George Orwell in the book <i>Animal Farm</i> or Napoleon as leader.</h3></center>
<center><h3>     He is also brave, because of this quote in the book "the most terrifying spectacle of all was Boxer, rearing up on his hind legs and striking out with his great iron-shod hoofs like a stallion"(Animal Farm), this quote shows that even when he is facing danger he did not act like a coward, instead he fight like a brave man.</h3></center>
<center><h3>     In conclusion, so many details shows that Boxer is a hard worker, loyal, and brave. But it did not go well at the end. This is why that he is my favorite character. R.I.P Boxer</h3></center>
<center><h3>--The End--</h3></center>
